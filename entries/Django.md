#Django



Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source. This is the official description of Django and it pretty much embodies the philosophy behind the Django project. 



Django powers many of the Web's most-used sites, like Pinterest and Instagram. Facebook uses Django for various behind-the-scenes utilities. And Disqus, one of the largest applications on the Internet, is a Django project. Django came from publishing, so it's no surprise that sites like The Washington Post and Smithsonian Magazine also use Django. But you maybe little interested in these sites and more interested in why you should care about Django. And this article will precisely help you with that. But, let's also talk about what this article is not. This article is not a tutorial teaching you about Django. There are already many articles written by experienced developers which will help you figure that. This article explains why you should care about Django, how is it relevant to you? And after you know that, we will point you in the right direction. Out of the many tutorials we have chosen a few select ones which were most helpful to us, and which we are sure will be most helpful to you.
